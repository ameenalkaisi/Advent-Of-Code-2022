The second part made me implement reverse brute search lol but I went back into my senses and did it right. The second part I feel is a bit better because the search function is more generalized, even though only for REVERSE searching.
	- generalized in the sense that you can pass an ending condition as a boolean function, which I thought was cool and made me more comfortable around using functions as parameters in Rust
	- also every time I saw an 'E' or 'S' as a value I converted it to 'e' and 'a' as opposed to only converting sometimes
